			"reasoning": "This task has medium complexity. It involves defining three new Prisma models (`Agent`, `AgentInteraction`, `AgentMemory`), establishing relationships with existing `User` and `Task` models, and applying a database migration. While not trivial, it's a standard database schema extension. The existing 5 subtasks are a bit too granular; 3-4 subtasks would be more efficient."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 24,
			"taskTitle": "Implement PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) Policies",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Given the existing subtasks, provide a detailed plan for 'Integrate Wasp Backend with PostgreSQL Session Variables', specifically outlining where in the Wasp backend code the `SET app.current_user_id` command should be executed to ensure it applies to all subsequent database operations for an authenticated user.",

This requires careful coordination of configurations and ensuring the authenticated user's context is correctly passed to ElizaOS operations. The existing 5 subtasks provide a comprehensive breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 26,
			"taskTitle": "Replace LLM Operations with ElizaOS Agent Calls",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Given the existing subtasks, detail the process for 'Identify Existing LLM Integration Points', including a methodology for auditing the codebase and examples of common LLM usage patterns to look for.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves significant refactoring across the Wasp backend to replace direct LLM API calls with invocations to ElizaOS agents. It requires identifying all existing LLM integration points, designing and defining appropriate ElizaOS agents, and implementing the logic to pass user context and task data to these agents while processing their structured responses. This is a core AI integration task with high complexity. The existing 5 subtasks are well-defined for this scope."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 27,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Agent Management Backend APIs",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Given the existing subtasks, provide specific examples of the `is Auth` and `context.user.id` checks that will be implemented in the backend functions for `updateAgent` and `deleteAgent` to enforce ownership.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves developing standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints for ElizaOS agents. Its complexity is medium-high due to the requirement for robust authentication and authorization (JWT-based, ownership checks via `context.user.id`), and the handling of JSON-structured `characterConfig` data. Implementing these operations securely and efficiently contributes to its complexity. The existing 5 subtasks are appropriate for this level of detail."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 28,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate ElizaOS Agent Management Dashboard UI",

			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Given the existing subtasks, detail the process for 'Prepare ElizaOS UI and Configure Environment Variable', including instructions for building and serving the ElizaOS UI as a standalone application and the exact `.env` configuration.",
			"reasoning": "This task has medium-high complexity. While embedding the ElizaOS UI via an `<iframe>` simplifies direct integration, it requires careful setup of the standalone ElizaOS web interface, precise environment variable configuration for routing, and thoughtful styling to ensure the embedded UI appears seamless within the Wasp application's existing design system. Communication between the parent Wasp app and the `<iframe>` also adds a layer of complexity. The existing 5 subtasks are well-structured for this task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 29,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Agent-Task Integration Logic",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Given the existing subtasks, elaborate on the specific fields and their types that will be added to the `Task` entity in 'Extend Task Database Schema for Agent Metadata', and how `elizaAgentInteractionId` will link to Task 24.",
			"reasoning": "This is a highly complex and central AI feature. It involves sophisticated natural language processing by ElizaOS agents to extract structured data (category, priority, dependencies, time estimates) from user input. This requires extending the core `Task` database schema, defining a precise API contract for agent communication, implementing robust backend logic to interact with the agent and persist its suggestions, and developing intuitive frontend components for input and suggestion display. Error handling for agent failures is also critical. The existing 5 subtasks provide a good breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 30,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Multi-Agent Workflows and Autonomous Features",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Given the existing subtasks, provide a detailed technical design for 'Implement Core Multi-Agent Collaboration Infrastructure', outlining the chosen communication mechanism (e.g., message queue, shared database), data structures for shared context, and how Row Level Security will be maintained.",
			"reasoning": "This task represents the pinnacle of AI sophistication for the project, making it extremely complex. It involves designing and implementing multi-agent collaboration mechanisms, agent specialization, autonomous task breakdown using LLMs, and intelligent scheduling algorithms.

			"taskTitle": "Comprehensive Logic and Error Audit",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "N/A (Task is marked as 'done' with detailed subtasks and findings already provided).",
			"reasoning": "While this task is an 'audit' rather than an 'implementation', its complexity is extremely high due to its comprehensive scope. It requires a deep, cross-cutting analysis of the entire codebase, covering core logic, error handling, database interactions (including RLS), authentication/authorization, general security vulnerabilities, UI interactions, and overall architectural soundness. The detailed findings provided in the 'info added' sections for its subtasks confirm the extensive and intricate nature of this analytical work. Since it's marked as 'done' with 8 detailed subtasks, the complexity reflects the effort required to complete the audit itself."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 33,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Phase 1 Security Hardening",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down 'Implement Phase 1 Security Hardening' into actionable subtasks, focusing on the key areas identified: Input Validation & Sanitization, Authentication & Authorization Enhancements, API Security Hardening, Secure Data Handling & Dependency Management, and Enhanced Error Handling & Logging.",
			"reasoning": "This task is critically important and extremely complex as it directly addresses multiple severe security vulnerabilities identified in the comprehensive audit (Task 32). It requires implementing robust fixes across the entire application stack (frontend, backend, database, infrastructure configuration). Each area (input validation, authentication, API security, data handling, dependency management, error logging, RLS verification) is complex on its own, and implementing them comprehensively and correctly without introducing new issues demands expert-level security knowledge and meticulous execution. Given its high priority and broad impact, it warrants a high complexity score and a detailed breakdown into actionable subtasks."
