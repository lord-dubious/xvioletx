# ElizaOS Integration Summary & Actions Taken

This document summarizes the progress and key decisions made during the integration of the ElizaOS agent framework into the Wasp application.

## Summary of Progress

The initial goal was to integrate ElizaOS. The first approach involved directly extending the Wasp application's Prisma schema (`app/schema.prisma`) with ElizaOS-specific models. This was found to be incorrect after reviewing the locally available ElizaOS source code in `app/eliza/`, which revealed that ElizaOS is a complete, self-contained application with its own database models, runtime, and client.

The strategy was revised to treat ElizaOS as a separate service and embed its pre-built client application directly into the Wasp frontend. This approach was successfully implemented.

## Key Actions Taken

1.  **Initial Analysis:**
    *   Reviewed the project structure, `CRUSH.md`, and the Wasp configuration (`main.wasp`, `schema.prisma`).
    *   Confirmed the ElizaOS codebase exists locally at `app/eliza/`.

2.  **Incorrect Schema Modification (Reverted):**
    *   Initially modified `app/schema.prisma` to include `Agent`, `AgentInteraction`, and `AgentMemory` models.
    *   This change was reverted after realizing ElizaOS manages its own schema.

3.  **Codebase Review & Strategy Pivot:**
    *   Inspected the ElizaOS documentation and source code, particularly the architecture overviews and the client application (`app/eliza/packages/client/src/App.tsx`).
    *   Shifted the integration strategy from database-level merging to frontend-level embedding.

4.  **Frontend Integration (Completed):**
    *   Created the directory `app/src/agent-management/`.
    *   Created the Wasp page component `app/src/agent-management/AgentsPage.tsx`.
    *   Implemented the `AgentsPage` to directly import and render the main `App` component from the ElizaOS client package. This makes the entire ElizaOS user interface available at the `/agents` route within the Wasp application.

5.  **Configuration:**
    *   Confirmed the `AgentsRoute` was already defined in `app/main.wasp`.
    *   An `app/.env` file was configured with the necessary `DATABASE_URL` and a placeholder `WASP_CLIENT_ELIZAOS_DASHBOARD_URL`.

## Final State

The frontend integration of the ElizaOS client is complete. The application now renders the ElizaOS dashboard on a dedicated, authenticated page. The next logical step would be to establish communication between the Wasp backend (Actions/Queries) and the ElizaOS backend service for dynamic, data-driven interactions.
